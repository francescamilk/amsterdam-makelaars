// BRIEFING

This project is the minimum viable product for a rental platform, usable both as a private client and as a real estate agent. 
<br><br>
The goal of the project is to practice OOP and MVC patterns in a real-life scenario, developing all four of the CRUD actions and encapsulating the privileges for each user type. <br><br>
The design voluntarily kept simple as the prototype could be adaptable to different buyers.

<br>

// PLAY WITH ME

You can sign up as a realtor and perform the CRUD actions live.
